1️⃣ What is Terraform and how does it help manage Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

**Terraform** is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool** developed by **HashiCorp**.

👉 It allows you to **define, create, update, and delete infrastructure using code** instead of doing things manually from cloud consoles.

### What does “Infrastructure as Code” mean?

Infrastructure (servers, networks, databases, load balancers, etc.) is:

* Written in **code files**
* Version-controlled (Git)
* Reusable & repeatable
* Automatically created

### Example (simple idea):

Instead of manually creating an EC2 instance in AWS console:

* Click → Launch instance → Select AMI → Configure → Review → Launch ❌

You write this in code:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "my_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

👉 Terraform reads this code and **creates the server for you**.

✅ This is how Terraform helps manage infrastructure **as code**, not clicks.

## 2️⃣ Why do we need Terraform and how does it simplify infrastructure provisioning?

### ❌ Problems with Manual Infrastructure

* Error-prone
* Time-consuming
* No record of what was created
* Hard to recreate the same setup
* Difficult for teams to collaborate

### ✅ Why Terraform is needed

Terraform solves all these issues.

### How Terraform simplifies provisioning:

#### 🔹 1. Automation

* One command → entire infrastructure is created

```bash
terraform apply
```

#### 🔹 2. Consistency

* Same code = same infrastructure every time
* No “it works on my account” problem

#### 🔹 3. Multi-Cloud Support

Terraform works with:

* **Amazon Web Services**
* **Microsoft Azure**
* **Google Cloud Platform**

Same syntax, different providers.

#### 🔹 4. Version Control

* Store Terraform code in Git
* Track who changed what and when

#### 🔹 5. Easy Scaling & Changes

Want to increase servers from 1 to 3?

```hcl
count = 3
```

Terraform figures out what to add/remove automatically.

## 3️⃣ How can you install Terraform and set up the environment for AWS, Azure, or GCP?

### 🔹 Step 1: Install Terraform

#### On Linux

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install terraform
```

#### Verify installation

```bash
terraform --version
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Set up Cloud Environment

Terraform uses **providers** to talk to cloud platforms.

---

### ✅ AWS Setup

1. Install AWS CLI
2. Configure credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter:

* Access Key
* Secret Key
* Region

3. Provider configuration:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}
```

---

### ✅ Azure Setup

1. Login:

```bash
az login
```

2. Provider configuration:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

---

### ✅ GCP Setup

1. Create service account key (JSON)
2. Set environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="key.json"
```

3. Provider configuration:

```hcl
provider "google" {
  project = "my-project"
  region  = "us-central1"
}
```

---

## 4️⃣ Important Terraform Terminologies (5 Crucial Ones with Examples)

### 🔹 1. Provider

**Provider** tells Terraform **which cloud or service to use**.

📌 Example:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}
```

👉 Here, Terraform knows it has to talk to AWS.

---

### 🔹 2. Resource

A **resource** is **any infrastructure component** you want to create.

📌 Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

👉 This creates an EC2 instance.

---

### 🔹 3. Variable

Variables make code **dynamic and reusable**.

📌 Example:

```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  default = "t2.micro"
}
```

Usage:

```hcl
instance_type = var.instance_type
```

👉 Change value once → affects everywhere.

---

### 🔹 4. State File (terraform.tfstate)

Terraform stores the **current state of infrastructure** in a state file.

👉 It keeps track of:

* What exists
* What Terraform created
* What needs to be changed

📌 Example:

```bash
terraform.tfstate
```

⚠️ Very important file — don’t delete it.

---

### 🔹 5. Plan & Apply

#### `terraform plan`

* Shows **what Terraform will do**
* No changes made

```bash
terraform plan
```

#### `terraform apply`

* Actually **creates/updates infrastructure**

```bash
terraform apply
```

👉 Think of it as:

* **Plan = Preview**
* **Apply = Execute**

---

Summary:
* **Terraform**: IaC tool to manage infrastructure using code
* **Why**: Automation, consistency, multi-cloud, version control
* **Install**: Install binary → configure provider credentials
* **Core terms**: Provider, Resource, Variable, State, Plan/Apply
